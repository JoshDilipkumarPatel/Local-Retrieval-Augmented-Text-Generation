🧠 Local Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation (RAG)

A fully offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines semantic search with transformer-based text generation.
This project demonstrates how to build a local, API-free pipeline for knowledge-grounded responses using Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, and FAISS.
